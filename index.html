												<h4>Rover Connect</h4>
												<p>Rover Connect is an API platform which allows external vendors to connect to the property management system to access or manipulate data. Authentication is handled by another application called “Rover Auth” which does the OAuth 2.0 protocol.</p>
												<h5>What I did:</h5>
												<ul>
													<li>Lead a team of 3 developers and a QA engineer.</li>														
													<li>Implemented OAuth 2.0 authentication layer to the application</li>
													<li>Developed multiple APIs using RESTful concept which is used by external vendors to access hotel data.</li>	
													<li>Designed the AWS API gateway and cognito user pool for the application</li>	
													<li>Implemented RAML to record the API specs</li>
												</ul>

												<h4>Interface Controller</h4>
												<p>The Rover Interface Controller (Rover IFC) is a micro service that integrates different
													integrations for StayNTouch PMS using the Pub/Sub model. The project involves
													listening to various events generated by the PMS application and based on that event,
													using the RPC method the application will communicate to different vendors via HTTP,
													Socket, Email, SFTP, S3 and other mechanisms in different content type formats (XML,
													JSON, TEXT, CSV etc).
												</p>
												<h5>What I did:</h5>
												<ul>
													<li>Developed action publish model which communicates with multiple consumers.</li>														
													<li>Integrated various third party CRS, CRM, RMS and back office, door lock and text messaging systems.</li>
													<li>Involved in various technical discussions with vendors prior to integration.</li>	
													<li>Designed, developed and documented various modules that handle integration data.</li>	
													<li>Involved in implementing RabbitMQ to exchange messages between the interface and data provider applications.</li>
													<li>Developed Webhook application for event reporting to vendors via HTTP.</li>
													<li>Integrated Point-of-Sale system with the property management system using the interface application.</li>
													<li>Walked clients and internal staff through troubleshooting steps to resolve common software issues.</li>
													<li>Worked closely with the QA Engineers to build the test scenarios.</li>
													<li>Worked with a team of engineers and product manager to generate a publishing model using Redis and map reducing technique, which improved overall performance of the system.</li>
												</ul>

												<h4>Property Management System</h4>
												<p>StayNTouch PMS (Property Management System) is Hotel Enterprise PMS overlay and Mobility Platform for the hotel guests and staff. The scope of the project involves a reservation 
													Check In/Checkout application with RestFul web services which can be used by the Rover and Zest applications. 
													The Rover Application which was developed in Ruby on Rails platform, 
													serves as the backend for guests and staff and also a connect engine 
													to the PMS named such as Opera. PMS also connects to another application called IFC, 
													which communicates with external vendors using XML, JSON. 
													Another product of Stayntouch is Rover Connect, 
													which provides 3rd party applications read & write access to hotel data within the Rover PMS.
													All 3rd party applications must register with the Rover API Portal. 
													The OAuth 2.0 standard is used by Rover. Hotels must grant 3rd party applications access to their data.
												</p>
												<h5>What I did:</h5>
												<ul>
													<li>Implemented APIs for client side support (built in angular)</li>														
													<li>Worked closely with a team of engineers and product owner to design and develop full architecture of the hotel availability module.</li>
													<li>Database design for iBeacon setup (for mobile and web apps)</li>	
													<li>Implemented Capistrano Auto-Deployment</li>	
													<li>Push notification implementation for iOS and Android (Back-End)</li>
													<li>Designed and developed reservation cancellation module which is key part of PMS</li>
													<li>Designed and developed a complete HouseKeeping module for Hotels.</li>
													<li>Implemented the inventory design for PMS.</li>
													<li>Worked in the development escalation team which is responsible for tackling sensitive production issues.</li>
													<li>Developed User Interface using Angular for various third party integration setups in PMS.</li>
													<li>Involved in overall optimization of the project and achieved performance</li>
